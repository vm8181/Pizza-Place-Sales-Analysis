This project is to improve the business of Plato's Pizza sales. We need to overview the data and need to get some meaningful insights which will help to improve the performace of business.
## Purpose
***Youâ€™ll be playing the role of a BI Consultant hired by Plato's Pizza, a Greek-inspired pizza place in New Jersey. You've been hired to help the restaurant use data to improve operations, and just received the following note:***

Things are going OK here at Plato's, but there's room for improvement. We've been collecting transactional data for the past year, but really haven't been able to put it to good use. Hoping you can analyze the data and put together a report to help us find opportunities to drive more sales and work more efficiently.
- What days and times do we tend to be busiest?
- How many pizzas are we making during peak periods?
- What are our best and worst selling pizzas?
- What's our average order value?
- How well are we utilizing our seating capacity? (we have 15 tables and 60 seats)
## Process
- ***Data gathering:*** I have used the folder as data source which contains 4 csv files. 
- ***Data exploration:*** To make better decisions on where to dig deeper into the data and to take a broad understanding of the business when asking more detailed questions.
- ***Data Cleansing:*** Fixed or removed incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset.
- ***Data Visualization:*** Import it into Power BI desktop to represent the data using different charts and graphs.
